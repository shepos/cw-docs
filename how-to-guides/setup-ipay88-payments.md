# Setup iPay88 Payments

You can accept credit cards online using [iPay88](https://www.ipay88.co.id/). It is currently supported in numerous countries with a variety of currencies. If iPay88 is not supported in your country you can apply to try Stripe. Below is our simple guide on setting up iPay88 and managing your account.

## How iPay88 Payments Work

When iPay88 is enabled, customers can choose from the online payment option when checking out. If a customer selects "Credit Card", the credit card field will drop-down below.

If you would like to do a test payment, copy your test API keys from iPay88. You can do this by toggling the "Viewing test data" switch.

Once this is done, you can use the credit card number "XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX" with any valid expiry, CVC and zip code. This card will allow you to make a dummy payment.

## Validating Your iPay88 Account

To withdraw online payments to your bank, you will need to ensure your iPay88 account is fully valid. Please, ensure you have completed all their required validations.

## iPay88 Fee's

We are not responsible for your iPay88 account management or fees. Your iPay88 account is simply linked to your SHEPOS account to process charges on your behalf with the money going straight to your account.

As such it is important you are aware of iPay88's payment processing fees. You can read more here [https://support.ipay88.co.id/general-information](https://support.ipay88.co.id/general-information). Please also take the time to read their FAQ and support to clear up any issues you may have.

## iPay88 Currency Conversions

iPay88 enables you to accept different currencies online depending on the country you are in. If your iPay88 currency is different from your store currency, we will convert the order amount to your iPay88 default currency using real-time exchange rates for payment to be made.

## Issuing Refunds

iPay88 refunds can be processed from your order management dashboard or the iPay88 dashboard. In the order management dashboard, the refund payment option is available in the order details popup. Simply press the action select bar and choose "Refund iPay88 Payment".
